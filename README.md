## Usage

This Work Day Scheduler allows you to schedule events between the hours of 9AM and 5PM, and shows the current date at the top of the page. 

It will present the hour row in the color red for the present, green for the future, and gray for the past.

Each hour block has an input field where the user can insert events and save to their local storage by clicking the save button.
