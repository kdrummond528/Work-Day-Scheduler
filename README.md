## Usage

This Work Day Scheduler allows you to schedule events between the hours of 9AM and 5PM, and shows the current date at the top of the page. 

It will display each hour row in different colors according to the time of day. The current or present hour will display in the color red, green for the future hours, and gray for the past hours.

Each hour block has an input field where the user can insert events, and save to their local storage by clicking the save button.
